# Building a Rich Console App

In this tutorial, we'll build a styled build-output display together. By the end, we'll have a complete status reporter that shows success messages in green, warnings in orange, errors in bold red, and includes clickable documentation links.

## 1. Create a New Project

Let's start by creating a new console application:

```bash
dotnet new console -n MySpectreApp
cd MySpectreApp
```

A new folder called MySpectreApp appears with a basic console application inside. Our project is ready.

## 2. Add Spectre.Console

Now let's add the Spectre.Console package:

```bash
dotnet add package Spectre.Console
```

The output confirms the package was installed. Now we're ready to write some code.

## 3. Display a Success Message

Let's start with a simple success message. We wrap text in color tags using `[green]text[/]`:

```csharp
AnsiConsole.MarkupLine("[green]✓ Build completed successfully[/]");
```

Run the code:
```bash
dotnet run
```

"✓ Build completed successfully" appears in green. See how `[/]` closes the style? Any text after it returns to the default color.

Done - our first styled message.

## 4. Add a Warning Message

Now let's add a warning. We'll use a hex color code `[#FFA500]` for the orange symbol, and mix styled and plain text on the same line:

```csharp
AnsiConsole.MarkupLineInterpolated($"[#FFA500]⚠[/] [yellow]3 warnings[/] in {fileName}");
```

Run the code:
```bash
dotnet run
```

The "⚠" appears in orange, "3 warnings" in yellow, and "in Authentication.cs" in the default color. Each style closes with `[/]` before the next one begins.

Now we're mixing colors and plain text on a single line.

## 5. Show an Error Message

Errors need to stand out. Let's combine bold and red in a single tag by separating them with a space:

```csharp
AnsiConsole.MarkupLineInterpolated($"[bold red]✗ Error:[/] Missing dependency '{dependency}'");
```

Run the code:
```bash
dotnet run
```

"✗ Error:" appears in bold red, followed by the dependency name in the default style. The `[bold red]` tag applies both styles at once.

Our error message really stands out now.

## 6. Include a Documentation Link

Let's help users find more information by adding a clickable link. We use `[link=URL]text[/]` to show friendly text instead of a raw URL:

```csharp
AnsiConsole.MarkupLine(" → See: [link=https://docs.example.com/dependencies]documentation[/]");
```

Run the code:
```bash
dotnet run
```

Look for "→ See: documentation" where "documentation" is a clickable link (in terminals that support it). The link opens the URL when clicked.

We've added helpful navigation to our output.

## 7. Handle Dynamic Content

Real build tools display filenames and counts that come from variables. Let's use `MarkupLineInterpolated()` to safely include dynamic values:

```csharp
AnsiConsole.MarkupLineInterpolated($"[#FFA500]⚠[/] [yellow]{warningCount} warnings[/] in {fileName}");
```

Run the code:
```bash
dotnet run
```

The same warning message appears, but now the filename and count come from variables. `MarkupLineInterpolated()` automatically escapes any brackets in the interpolated values, preventing markup parsing errors.

See the [Markup Widget](/console/widgets/markup) reference for more on escaping.

## 8. Complete Build Output

Now let's combine everything into our final build-output display:

```csharp
var fileName = "Authentication.cs";
var dependency = "Newtonsoft.Json";

AnsiConsole.MarkupLine("[green]✓ Build completed successfully[/]");
AnsiConsole.MarkupLineInterpolated($"[#FFA500]⚠[/] [yellow]3 warnings[/] in {fileName}");
AnsiConsole.MarkupLineInterpolated($"[bold red]✗ Error:[/] Missing dependency '{dependency}'");
AnsiConsole.MarkupLine(" → See: [link=https://docs.example.com/dependencies]documentation[/]");
```

Run the code:
```bash
dotnet run
```

All four lines of our build output appear: the green success message, the orange/yellow warning with the filename, the bold red error with the dependency name, and the clickable documentation link.

Our build-output display is complete.

## Summary

You've created a styled build-output display from scratch. Your reporter shows success in green, warnings in custom orange, errors in bold red, and includes clickable documentation links - all with safe handling of dynamic content.

Apply these patterns to any console application: log viewers, deployment scripts, test runners, and more.
