# Asking User Questions

In this tutorial, we'll build a pizza ordering system that collects user input. By the end, you'll know how to ask for text, let users choose from lists, and confirm their selections.

> ⚠️ Prompts are not thread safe. Using them together with other interactive components such as progress displays, status displays, or other prompts is not supported.

## 1. Ask for the Customer's Name

Let's start by asking for the customer's name. The `Ask()` method displays a prompt and waits for input:

```csharp
var name = AnsiConsole.Ask("What's your [green]name[/]?");
AnsiConsole.MarkupLine($"Welcome, [blue]{name}[/]!");
```

Run the code:
```bash
dotnet run
```

"What's your name?" appears with a cursor waiting for input. Type your name and press Enter. The program then greets you by name.

See how we used `[green]` markup in the prompt? You can style your prompts just like any other Spectre.Console output.

You've captured your first user input.

## 2. Choose a Pizza Size

Now let's let the user pick from a list of options. A `SelectionPrompt` shows an interactive menu where users navigate with arrow keys:

```csharp
var size = AnsiConsole.Prompt(
    new SelectionPrompt()
        .Title("What [green]size pizza[/] would you like?")
        .AddChoices("Small", "Medium", "Large", "Extra Large"));

AnsiConsole.MarkupLine($"You selected: [yellow]{size}[/]");
```

Run it:
```bash
dotnet run
```

A list of pizza sizes appears with one highlighted. Use the up/down arrow keys to move between options, then press Enter to select.

The prompt handles all the keyboard interaction - no need to parse input or validate choices. Spectre.Console takes care of it.

An interactive menu with just a few lines of code.

## 3. Select Your Toppings

What if the user wants to pick multiple items? That's where `MultiSelectionPrompt` comes in. Users can toggle items with the spacebar and confirm with Enter:

```csharp
var toppings = AnsiConsole.Prompt(
    new MultiSelectionPrompt()
        .Title("What [green]toppings[/] would you like?")
        .NotRequired()
        .InstructionsText("[grey](Press [blue]Space[/] to toggle, [green]Enter[/] to confirm)[/]")
        .AddChoices("Pepperoni", "Mushrooms", "Sausage",
            "Onions", "Green Peppers", "Black Olives",
            "Extra Cheese", "Bacon", "Pineapple"));

if (toppings.Count == 0)
{
    AnsiConsole.MarkupLine("A plain cheese pizza - classic choice!");
}
else
{
    AnsiConsole.MarkupLine($"Toppings: [yellow]{string.Join(", ", toppings)}[/]");
}
```

Run it:
```bash
dotnet run
```

A list of toppings appears with checkboxes. Press Space to select or deselect items, use arrow keys to navigate, and press Enter when you're done.

The `NotRequired()` call allows zero items to be selected (for a plain cheese pizza). Without it, at least one selection would be required.

Your users can now make multiple selections.

## 4. Confirm the Order

Before placing the order, let's ask for confirmation. The `Confirm()` method presents a simple yes/no question:

```csharp
var confirmed = AnsiConsole.Confirm("Place this order?");

if (confirmed)
{
    AnsiConsole.MarkupLine("[green]Order placed![/]");
}
else
{
    AnsiConsole.MarkupLine("[yellow]Order cancelled.[/]");
}
```

Run it:
```bash
dotnet run
```

"Place this order? [y/n]" appears with options to type y or n. The method returns true for yes and false for no.

The `[y/n]` hint is automatically added - Spectre.Console handles common UX patterns for you.

Now you can get confirmation before important actions.

## 5. Complete Pizza Order

Let's put it all together into a complete ordering flow with a styled order summary:

```csharp
AnsiConsole.MarkupLine("[bold yellow]Welcome to Spectre Pizza![/]");
AnsiConsole.WriteLine();

// Ask for name
var name = AnsiConsole.Ask("What's your [green]name[/]?");

// Choose size
var size = AnsiConsole.Prompt(
    new SelectionPrompt()
        .Title("What [green]size pizza[/] would you like?")
        .AddChoices("Small", "Medium", "Large", "Extra Large"));

// Select toppings
var toppings = AnsiConsole.Prompt(
    new MultiSelectionPrompt()
        .Title("What [green]toppings[/] would you like?")
        .NotRequired()
        .InstructionsText("[grey](Press [blue]Space[/] to toggle, [green]Enter[/] to confirm)[/]")
        .AddChoices("Pepperoni", "Mushrooms", "Sausage",
            "Onions", "Green Peppers", "Black Olives",
            "Extra Cheese", "Bacon", "Pineapple"));

// Show order summary
AnsiConsole.WriteLine();
var panel = new Panel(
    new Rows(
        new Markup($"[bold]Customer:[/] {name}"),
        new Markup($"[bold]Size:[/] {size}"),
        new Markup($"[bold]Toppings:[/] {(toppings.Count > 0 ? string.Join(", ", toppings) : "Plain cheese")}"))
    .Header("[yellow]Order Summary[/]")
    .Border(BoxBorder.Rounded));
AnsiConsole.Write(panel);
AnsiConsole.WriteLine();

// Confirm order
if (AnsiConsole.Confirm("Place this order?"))
{
    AnsiConsole.MarkupLine($"[green]Order placed! Thanks, {name}![/]");
}
else
{
    AnsiConsole.MarkupLine("[yellow]Order cancelled.[/]");
}
```

Run the complete application:
```bash
dotnet run
```

The full ordering experience unfolds: enter your name, pick a size, select toppings, review the summary in a styled panel, and confirm your order.

We used a Panel to display the order summary - combining prompts with other Spectre.Console widgets creates polished, professional interfaces.

A complete interactive ordering flow.

## Summary

You've created a pizza ordering system that demonstrates all the core prompting features. Your application asks for text input, presents single-choice and multiple-choice menus, displays a styled summary, and confirms the order before processing.

Use these prompts in configuration wizards, CLI tools, installation scripts, and anywhere you need user input.
